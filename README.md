# VerticalTab
A jQuery plugin I wrote to help vertically tab through inputs in a table. It's just a simple bit of JavaScript that could probably be improved, and I wanted to share with some clients.

Tested as far back as jQuery 1.7.2. 

Include jQuery prior to this script.  Simply initialize the vertical tab behavior by calling something like: 

    $('#tableId tbody').verticalTab();

Hope it's helpful to someone, or gives them an idea if they want to do something similar on their own.
